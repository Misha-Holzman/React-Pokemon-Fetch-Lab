# Pokeomon with React & Fetch
![:image](https://media.giphy.com/media/amrNGnZUeWhZC/giphy.gif)


Gotta fetch em all!

## Directions

### Part 1

1. Using the starter code, make a fetch call to grab all of the pokemon and set them in state
1. Still in the App component, map over the pokemon and return a list of clickable buttons that display the pokemon's name


### Part 2

1. Make a handle click method that passes the pokemon url to a second fetch call that gets data about the individual pokemon that was clicked on.
1. Pass props to the single pokemon componenet, which should include the height, weight, and an image of the pokemon.



We'll be using the [poke api](https://pokeapi.co/) to complete this exercise.

This is the url you will pass into your initial fetch call (http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20)
